## Sidebar Options

Within **Sidebar Options**, you can toggle the following settings:

## Advanced Options

The **Advanced Options** menu offers more control over what’s shown on your sidebar:

1. **Texts**  
   - You can add up to three custom text lines to your sidebar.  
   - Enter any text you like for each line, leaving lines blank if you don’t need them.

2. **Objectives**  
   - Add up to four custom objectives from the scoreboard.
   - Note: Some objectives like “Money,” “Kills,” and “Deaths” are reserved, so you won’t be able to add them here as custom objectives.

## Tips

- **Special Toggles**: Some reserved objectives like “Money,” “Kills,” and “Deaths” can only be enabled through the main Sidebar Options menu, so use those toggles to display them.
- **Player Location**: If coordinates are enabled, your exact location will be shown on your sidebar, making it easier to navigate or share your location with others.

Use the Sidebar Creator to keep important information at a glance and customize it to match your style!
