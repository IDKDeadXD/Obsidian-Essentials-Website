## Features

### Edit Kick Message

To edit the message shown to kicked players:

1. Select **Edit Kick Message** from the Main Menu.
2. Type a new message in the provided field.
3. Save your changes, and you’ll see a confirmation message.

### Bypass Tags/Players

Use this feature to manage who can bypass the shutdown system.

1. **Bypass Menu Options**:
   - **List Bypass Tags/Players**: View all players and tags currently bypassed.
   - **Add Tag/Player**: Add a specific player or tag to the bypass list.

2. **Adding a Bypass**:
   - Choose **Add Tag** or **Add Player**.
   - Enter the name of the tag or player.
   - Confirm, and you’ll see a message indicating that they were added.

3. **Managing Bypasses**:
   - In the list, select any tag or player to **Edit** or **Delete** them from the bypass list.
   - **Edit** allows renaming and changing between a tag and player bypass.
   - **Delete** removes them from the bypass list entirely.

### Shutdown Toggle

Use the **Shutdown Toggle** option to enable or disable the shutdown system. 

- If enabled, only bypassed players/tags are allowed to join the server.
