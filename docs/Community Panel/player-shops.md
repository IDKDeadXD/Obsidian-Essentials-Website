## Notes and Tips
- **Public or Private Shop:** Your shop is public by default, meaning other players can browse and buy from it.
- **Inventory Space:** Ensure you have inventory space when buying items, as full inventories will result in items dropping at your location.
- **Shop Deletion:** Deleting your shop will permanently remove all items listed.

Enjoy trading and building a thriving economy in your realm! ðŸŽ‰
